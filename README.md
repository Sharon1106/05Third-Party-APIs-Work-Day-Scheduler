# 05-Third-Party-APIs-Work-Day-Scheduler
## User Story
```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```
```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar -->
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
### Description:
For this assignment I used several API's: Bootstrap  https://getbootstrap.com/ | jQuery https://jquery.com/ | Moment.j.s https://momentjs.com/
I used the 3rd party API's to set the layout, to recieve the time and to save to local storage.
I created seperate functions to set the colors for the text areas, save text info and display the saved info.
