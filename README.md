# 05-Third-Party-APIs-Work-Day-Scheduler
## Description:
A daily schedule for your average work day with color changing input areas depending on the hour. 

###
I used the 3rd party API's to set the layout, to recieve the time and to save to local storage.
I used seperate functions to set the colors for the text areas, save text info and display the saved info. 
### Tools Used: 
For this assignment I used the following API's: Bootstrap  https://getbootstrap.com/ | jQuery https://jquery.com/ | Moment.j.s https://momentjs.com/
